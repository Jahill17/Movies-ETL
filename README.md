# Movies-ETL

The background of this assignment required me to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. This included refactoring code from earlier in this module to create a function taht takes in the following fields: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data.  An ETL process was performed by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

## Deliverables

- Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
- Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
- Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
- Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database

## Files Used

- ETL deliverable 1 starter code
- ETL deliverable 2 starter code
- ETL deliverable 3 starter code

## Results

- 26,024,289 rows in the ratings file
